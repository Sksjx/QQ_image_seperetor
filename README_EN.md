Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of randomly-named folders in your computer's qq save directory, “.../Tencent Files/Your QQ Number/Image/Group2”, where a large number of randomly named folders are stored, and each folder contains randomly named pictures?

This program is designed to separate the useless parts from the qq cache images, leaving most of the hentai images.

The specific operation is as follows: 
1. In your file manager, please find “.... /Tencent Files/your QQ number/Image/Group2”, in the upper right corner of the search box, enter the English period ‘.’ and click Search

2. When the search is finished, slide the right scroll bar from top to bottom, find the first picture and left click once, then use the mouse to drag the right scroll bar to the bottom picture, shift+left click once.

3. If the second step of the operation is correct, at this time you should have selected all the pictures, press ctrl + x or press ctrl + c , and then paste into another folder

4. Open the program, set the input folder to the folder you just copied file to, and then set the output folder to any place you like. Select core numbers and options on leftside, then start running the program.

Note: The more cores you selected, the more computer resources consumed, it is recommended to start from 4 cores. Image entropy function will consume a huge amount of time, about a single picture takes 1min40s, it is not recommended to use this function currently!

Failed useing pyinstaller to packa the program, looking for help!
